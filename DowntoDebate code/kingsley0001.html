Crime may happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime, and obviously it creates a victim, who is usually innocent. Assuming our law enforcer is reliable, the crime suspect will soon be delivered a verdict. A verdict that caters to the need for protection, rehabilitation, deterrence, and punishment, in order to bring justice. The story does not end here, though. Justice plays a crucial role in society, especially to bring order and achieve peace (though it is impossible to have peace, but at least it brings us steps closer to it). The flaw in internet law is that there is no actual deterrence effect and sense of protection for the victims. The possible punishment on the net, such as banning your ID/IP address, will not prevent the crime from happening again. The untraceable feature of anonymity will always let the criminal get away from his evil work. Hence, the cycle of digital crime is unable to be stopped and victims are just inevitable. It will only lead us to a space where only the strong (in this case, the villain) lives, neglecting every human right that you have.</span></p>

Anonymity gives protection for the pirate (that is what they want to be addressed) to spread the illegal copies on the network. Generally speaking, piracy is driven by curiosity in knowing what are things inside the product (A better demo/ trial version). The best outcome is when you are satisfied with the products offered, then you are going to buy it. However, what happens in reality is that, when you have already owned it illegally, why should you own it legally? The harm of such a mindset is undoubtedly on the director/ developer/ artist/ other-digital-related profession. When an art is not being appreciated, for sure, it is going to demotivate the artists. Economically speaking, we are aware of how much capital is needed in order to create a masterpiece. The capital not only comes in money but also in ideas and artists&apos; dedication in making it perfect. Let us put ourselves in the shoes of the artist. The artists are trying to make a living from their work. On the other hand, they spent much time making it authentic and exclusive. In their own cycle of improvement, the experiences gained from one project later improve the next project. Such professional development plays a crucial role in creating better work in the future, especially in the digital creative industry. When we steal what they deserved, it will simply send a message to them that we do not value what they have done because we are not willing to pay for their hard work. That will be the time when artists quit their job, for their art piece cannot feed them anymore.</span></p>

Although anonymity is part of exercising privacy, it is not the other way around. The nature of privacy is to create space between a person and his/her environment, which is to limit the information flow. On the other hand, anonymity is to be given a power or privilege that can either be used for constructive or destructive purposes. A simple example of anonymity and cyberbullying can be seen on certain social media such as Ask.fm where people without identity can simply throw hate comments that you do not deserve just to break you down. That is a point where anonymity has been exercised way beyond its main purpose.</span></p>

None of them have their human rights not violated. It is worse when the world is not aware or does not notice the existence of the dictatorship. This is the moment for social activists to achieve change by first reaching out to the international community for support. However, before the heroic act (read: treason) is executed, one has to secure one&apos;s identity during one&apos;s revolutionary act. By being unidentifiable, an oppressive government would not be able to violate the freedom of speech any further.</span></p>

The fear of being punished or even hunted by the unsatisfied side will not create a counterbalance of control and information. Furthermore, it is bad for democracy when a certain aspiration/message/truth is not being addressed to the surface. In every side of the world as long as humans are still in charge, personal interest or hidden agenda will always come into existence for none of us are capable enough to not let our ego take control. It is worse when one party has more power than the other (read: Welcome to the age of tyranny). Obviously speaking, we know what the evil party is capable of, such as labeling certain groups as traitors/terrorists/etc., which later serves as a justification in shutting them down. With anonymity, an oppressive government will no longer be able to keep bullying its people, and the check and balance in governing is exercised, at least. In short, the government is no longer invincible. Lastly, such elaboration is also applicable in any sort of scenario as long as it involves a bully and a victim.</span></p>

Now, let us show you how it is used accordingly by law enforcers. For introduction, when the government first decided to ban drugs, some people were unhappy and decided to start their own illegal business, known as the dark market. We know how hard it is for police to actually shut the whole operation down. They need a lot of investment and preparation, which is mostly dangerous. A classic Hollywood example would be: A police personnel is put on a mission that involves disguise and joining a criminal gang, which takes a really long time for the strategy to proceed. Now that our world has gone modern and illegal trade is done first on the internet, anonymity made them able to compete more efficiently with the bad guy. Both of them rely on the mutual unidentifiable platform. Nepotism or betrayal or organized crime is more unlikely to hamper the preparation stage.</span></p>

However, the problem lies not in being anonymous but rather on how people do not possess the conscience or rational capacity to not harm/steal from others. There are also ongoing affirmative actions done by our government in combatting cybercrime. Results may not be significant yet, but for the very least, organic positive change is there. It is shown in how the FBI has successfully taken several pirates down.</span></p>
