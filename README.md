# Jack Zhang - Projects

The projects within this respiratory are accumulated throughout high school. It also includes my attempts at USACO questions. The way the projects are split are into 3 difficulties, in which if you are looking to work on a project you can follow. I also included the code I used to create: down-to-debate.com, a debate website for one of my schoolmates. Projects that start with CB stands for projects worked on within my Club and the rest are just personal projects.

Contributors within this respisratory are people within my Club.
